# Markov_chain_weather_prediction

This project was mainly built for weather prediction using Markov chain.

We have used a dataset from Meteo Rwanda for three locations which are Rutsiro,Mukunguri,and Kaduha.

We have predicted the weather based on steady states probabilities calculated using meteo dataset provided.

For this project , we have predicted how the following days will behave either it will rain or not.
